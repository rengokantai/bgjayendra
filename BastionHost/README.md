## Bastion Host Overview
###Key points
- Bastion host is deployed in the Public subnet and acts as a proxy or a gateway between you and your instances
- Bastion host is a security measure that helps to reduce attack on your infrastructure and you have to concentrate to hardening a single layer
- __Bastion host allows you to login to instances in the Private subnet securely without having to store the private keys on the Bastion host (using ssh-agent forwarding or RDP gateways)__
- Bastion host security can be further tightened to allow SSH/RDP access from specific trusted IPs or corporate IP ranges
- Bastion host for your AWS infrastructure shouldnâ€™t be used for any other purpose, as that could open unnecessary security holes
- Security for all the Instances in the private subnet should be hardened to __accept SSH/RDP connections only from the Bastion host__
- __Deploy a Bastion host within each Availability Zone for HA, because if the Bastion instance or the AZ hosting the Bastion server goes down the ability to connect to your private instances is lost completely__
